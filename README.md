# Campanula
## A completely customizable pomdoro experience.

The pomodoro technique, created by Italian author Francesco Cirillio in the '80s, is a popular time-management technique generally used to split long tasks into smaller, more digestible intervals. At its most basic, the pomodoro technique utilizes a timer to break a task into work and break intervals followed by a longer break after a certain amount of work-break periods (known as "pomodoros").

Campanula aims to make the process of using the pomodoro technique as simple and unintrusive as possible while allowing you to customize your timer to cater to your specification.
